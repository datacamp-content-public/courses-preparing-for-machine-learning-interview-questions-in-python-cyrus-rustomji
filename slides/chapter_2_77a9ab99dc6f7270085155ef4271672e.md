Hello everyone and welcome to Preparing for Machine Learning Interview Questions in Python.
In this first lesson, we will learn how to spot if an interviewer is asking questions on a Linear Regression model, how to create one in Python, and regularize it.

## Linear Regression Overview

```yaml
type: "FullImageSlide"
key: "208994397a"

`@script`
So first, a quick overview, a linear regression model is a model that summarizes and studies relationships between two continuous variables, a predictor variables (denoted as X) vs. response variable (denoted as y).

## Regularization Overview

`@script`
Here is a quick overview, for regularizing a linear regression model. The left is the L1 norm which drops of independent variables if it will better the models accuracy, while the right L2 norm will weight independent variables on a scale of 0 - 1 of how important each metric is. The elastic net as you know combines both. Drawing this and explaining what you're drawing for interviewers during an interview will show that you understand the interworkings of L1 and L2 norms and elastic net.

## Q & A

```yaml

`@part1`
Which model would be best to use if your goal is to predict the US immigration quota?

a. SVM

b. Logistic Regression

c. Linear Regression

d. Naive Bayes


Answer C {{2}}


`@script`
Which model would be best to use if your goal is to predict the US immigration quota?

(Pause for 10 seconds)

The correct answer is C because you’re trying to predict a number. The other three models outputs have probabilistic outcomes, which would not work for predicting the US immigration quota.

## Building a Linear Regression Model

```yaml
type: "FullCodeSlide"
key: "2d1eba009c"
center_content: true
```

`@part1`
```
from sklearn linear model import LinearRegression
X = df[‘X1’,’X2’,’X3’]
y = df[‘y’]
lr1 = LinearRegression()
lr1.fit(X,y)
lr1.score(X,y)
```


`@script`
This is how to build a Linear Regression model when asked to build one during an interview. Make sure to mention that you use sklearn as that is a highly functional data science library used for almost every major data science model.

## Building Elastic Net Metrics

```yaml
type: "FullCodeSlide"
key: "e485feeb52"
```

`@part1`
```
from sklearn.linear_model import ElasticNet
alpha = 1e-5
enet = ElasticNet(alpha=alpha)
y_pred_enet = enet.fit(X_test, y_test)
y_pred_enet.score(X_test,y_test)
```

## Let's practice!

```yaml
type: "FinalSlide"
key: "a629224bde"
```

`@script`
Now let's practice and see if you can answer more questions relating to linear regression models and build one from scratch.
