Hello everyone and welcome to Preparing for Machine Learning Interview Questions in Python.
In this first lesson, we will learn how to spot if an interviewer is asking questions on a Linear Regression model, how to create one in Python, and how to regularize it.

## Linear Regression Overview

```yaml
type: "FullImageSlide"
key: "208994397a"
```

`@script`
So first, a quick overview, a linear regression model is a model that summarizes and studies relationships between two continuous variables, predictor variables (denoted as X) vs. response variable (denoted as y).

As you know, the vertical axis is the response variable, whereas the horizontal axis are the predictor variables.

## Regularization Overview

```yaml
type: "FullImageSlide"
key: "733505f2dd"
```

`@part1`

`@script`
Here is a quick overview, for regularizing a linear regression model.

The left is the L1 norm which drops or keeps the predictor variables if it will better the models accuracy, while the right L2 norm will weight predictor variables on a scale of 0 - 1 of how important each metric is.

The elastic net as you know combines both.

Drawing this and explaining what you're drawing for interviewers during an interview will show that you understand the interworkings of L1 and L2 norms and elastic net.

## Q & A

```yaml
type: "FullCodeSlide"
key: "15b0cab39d"
```

`@part1`
Which dataset would best fit a linear regression?

a. Predicting if an album will go platinum or not

b. Recognizing digits

c. Predicting the US immigration quota

d. Uber price prediction


Answer C {{2}}


`@script`
Here is a quick Q&A on Which dataset would best fit a linear regression? And I'll pause for a bit, so y'all can figure it out.

(Pause for 10 seconds)

The correct answer is C because it is trying to predict a number whereas A is a classification problem, B is a computer vision problem, and D requires seasonal data making it more complex than a linear regression.

## Building a Linear Regression Model

```yaml
type: "FullCodeSlide"
key: "2d1eba009c"
center_content: true
```

`@part1`
```
from sklearn linear model import LinearRegression
X = df[‘X1’,’X2’,’X3’]
y = df[‘y’]
lr1 = LinearRegression()
lr1.fit(X,y)
lr1.score(X,y)
```


`@script`
This is how to build a Linear Regression model when asked to build one during an interview.
Make sure to mention that you use sklearn as that is a highly functional data science library used for almost every major data science model.
Also, mention which are the predictor variables and response variables, so the interviewer knows your thought process.

## Building Elastic Net Metrics

```yaml
type: "FullCodeSlide"
key: "e485feeb52"
```

`@part1`
```
from sklearn.linear_model import ElasticNet
alpha = 1e-5
enet = ElasticNet(alpha=alpha)
y_pred_enet = enet.fit(X_test, y_test)
y_pred_enet.score(X_test,y_test)
```


`@script`
This is how to build elastic net metrics when asked to build one during an interview.
Make sure to mention why you are using an elastic net and why it is important to see what the metrics are for each predictor variable.

## Let's practice!

```yaml
type: "FinalSlide"
key: "a629224bde"
```

`@script`
Now let's practice and see if you can answer more questions relating to linear regression models and build one from scratch.
